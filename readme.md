# DAO Meeting 
## About
An in-world DAO headquarters where users participate in discussions, review proposals, and view past proposals. This public forum of governance is open to all members of the community all the time and hosts meetups, roundtables, regular town halls, and other DAO events.

## Background
This scene is the result of a $3000 grant in 2021 to specify and develop a town hall for DAO. Half of the funds were spent on design and the other half on development. Most development time went into the functionality of the UI, allowing users to synchronize a queue of proposals for discussion and read the details of proposals individually, live.

## Use
The scene is deployed at play.decentraland.org/?realm=trev.dcl.eth
